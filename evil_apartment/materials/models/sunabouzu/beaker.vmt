//Hey you! You get a free tip for looking at the .vmt's! Source cannot have two
//different values for transparency in one texture. Thats why two models have variations
//of the same texture. I had to split the beaker and it's base up to get the beaker
//transparent but the base not, originally they were one model. Welp thats the story.
//Have a nice day!
