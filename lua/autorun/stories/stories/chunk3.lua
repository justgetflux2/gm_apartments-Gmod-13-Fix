		"Snow quietly piles up outside. A small woman gazes at the flakes in silent awe from her balcony. The peace seems as if it will go on forever. Suddenly from behind her a man yells. She knows the man, normally a timid, reserved person, but now viciously pointing at her and yelling. The woman does not understand. This is her last mistake.", 
		"With a gentleness reserved for animals she slowly approaches the man. The woman has handled many situations like this one. The man shivers with something approaching joy as he tears her arm off. The woman had never before dealt with an animal who truly wanted to kill her.", 
		"Worlds blurred as the woman fell to the floor. A pool of memories leaking from her cracked skull, knowledge and thought were leaving the woman. Finally one last thought drips from her mind.", 
		"Regret.",
		"As the man hurries away from the heap of flesh on the floor all he feels is regret. The woman remains on the floor for hours until finally two men approach. They know what has happened. They know what to do. The men bury her where the flowers will be able to grow. No funeral, no crying, just silent acknowledgement and acceptance."
