// Physics Sounds
//
//	NOTE:  CHAN_BODY is used by sounds in many cases, but the code
//   uses CHAN_STATIC in others, so I didn't specify a channel here
//  Volume is determined procedurally by the physics code
// NOTE FROM SUNABOUZU: This is my very angry attempt to get proper carpet footstep sounds. Please do not fuck //with this. Feel free to turn this into a community sounds thing though.
